📊 Forbes Global 2000 (2025) – Data Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes the Forbes Global 2000 (2025) dataset to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow. The goal is to practice data extraction (SQL), exploratory and business analysis (Excel), and interactive reporting (Power BI).

It is designed as a practice project to develop skills required in a corporate data analytics environment.

🔑 Key Objectives

- Load and query the Forbes dataset using MS SQL Server.

- Extract meaningful insights with business-focused SQL queries.

- Perform Excel-based analysis with PivotTables and charts.

- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for executive storytelling.

Practice data storytelling and presentation-ready formatting.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MS SQL Server) – Data extraction, cleaning, transformations.

- Excel – PivotTables, charts, business insights, report formatting.

- Power BI – Dashboard design, KPI visualization, storytelling.

📂 Project Workflow
- 1. SQL Queries

Industry vs Profit Margin

Country vs Total Market Value

Top Companies by Profit

Additional exploratory queries to test business perspectives

- 2. Excel Analysis

Imported query results into Excel.

Built PivotTables and charts to summarize insights.

Example insights:

Which industries yield the highest profit margins?

Which countries hold the largest total market value?

Who are the top-performing companies by profit?

- 3. Power BI Dashboard

Designed an interactive dashboard (forbesdatavisual.pbix).

Included KPI cards, charts, and drilldowns.

Focus on executive-ready storytelling (profit trends, industry comparisons, country insights).

📈 Key Insights (Sample)

- Certain industries consistently achieve higher profit margins.

- A few countries dominate the global market value distribution.

- Top 10 companies account for a disproportionately high share of global profits.

- (Details visualized in Excel & Power BI reports)

🚀 Next Steps & Improvements

- Refine Excel visuals to be more presentation-ready (themes, polished formatting).

- Improve Power BI storytelling → executive summary → breakdowns → deeper insights.

- Extend to time-series analysis if multi-year data becomes available.

- Automate SQL → Power BI pipeline for efficiency.
