Key Takeaways from the EDA
Based on all of your analysis (Univariate, Bivariate, and Correlation Matrix), you can finalize the main drivers of house price:

1. Grade is the Top Predictor: With a correlation of ρ=0.71, the quality of construction and design (grade) is the single best linear predictor of price.

2. Size Matters: sqft_living (ρ=0.70) is almost equally important. Note the high correlation between sqft_living and sqft_above (ρ=0.85, seen in the heatmap) and between sqft_living and sqft_living15 (ρ=0.78), indicating these features largely measure the same thing: house size.

3. Location (Latitude) is Important: The lat (latitude) ρ=0.40 correlation confirms the visual hotspot finding—houses in specific northern/central neighborhoods are significantly more expensive.

4. Age/Time are Weak Factors: The low correlation coefficients for House_Age (ρ=−0.064) and Years_Since_Renovation (ρ=−0.117) suggest that, after accounting for factors like Grade and Size, the raw age of the house is not a strong driver of price in this dataset.
